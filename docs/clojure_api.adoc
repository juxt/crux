=== db

[source,clojure]
----
  (db

    [node ^Date valid-time]
    [node ^Date valid-time ^Date transaction-time]
    "When a valid time is specified then returned db value contains only those
     documents whose valid time is before the specified time.

     When both valid and transaction time are specified returns a db value as of
     the valid time and the latest transaction time indexed at or before the
     specified transaction time.

     If the node hasn't yet indexed a transaction at or past the given
     transaction-time, this throws NodeOutOfSyncException")

     This DB opens up shared resources to make multiple requests faster - it must
     be `.close`d when you've finished using it (for example, in a `with-open`
     block)")

=== document

[source,clojure]
----
  (document [node content-hash]

=== sync

[source,clojure]
----
 (sync
    [node]
    [node ^Duration timeout]
    "Blocks until the node has caught up indexing to the latest tx available at
  the time this method is called. Will throw an exception on timeout. The

  consistent reads.

  timeout â€“ max time to wait, can be nil for the default.

  (listen ^java.lang.AutoCloseable [node event-opts f]
    "Attaches a listener to Crux's event bus.

  `event-opts` should contain `:crux/event-type`, along with any other options the event-type requires.

  We currently only support one public event-type: `:crux/indexed-tx`.
  Supplying `:with-tx-ops? true` will include the transaction's operations in the event passed to `f`.

  `(.close ...)` the return value to detach the listener.

  This is an experimental API, subject to change.")
----

=== tx-log

[source,clojure]
----
(open-tx-log ^ICursor [this after-tx-id with-ops?]
  "Reads the transaction log. Optionally includes

[#clojure-api-icruxdatasource]
== ICruxDatasource
Represents the database as of a specific valid and transaction time.

=== entity

[source,clojure]
----
  (entity [db eid]
    "queries a document map for an entity.
    eid is an object which can be coerced into an entity id.
    returns the entity document map.")
----

=== entity-tx

[source,clojure]
----
  (entity-tx [db eid]

----

=== q

[source,clojure]
----
  (q
    [db query]
    "q[uery] a Crux db.

     This function will return a set of result tuples if you do not specify `:order-by`, `:limit` or `:offset`;
     otherwise, it will return a vector of result tuples.)
----

=== open-q

[source,clojure]
----
  (open-q
    [db query]
    "lazily q[uery] a Crux db.
     query param is a datalog query in map, vector or string form.

     This function returns a Cursor of result tuples - once you've consumed
     as much of the sequence as you need to, you'll need to `.close` the sequence.
     A common way to do this is using `with-open`:

     (with-open [res (crux/open-q db '{:find [...]
                                       :where [...]})]
       (doseq [row (iterator-seq res)]
         ...))

     Once the sequence is closed, attempting to iterate it is undefined.
     ")

=== entity-history

[source,clojure]
----
  (entity-history
    [db eid sort-order]
    [db eid sort-order {:keys [with-docs? with-corrections?]

                        {end-vt :crux.db/valid-time, end-tt :crux.tx/tx-time} :end}]
    "Eagerly retrieves entity history for the given entity.

    Options:
    * `sort-order`: `#{:asc :desc}`
    * `:with-docs?`: specifies whether to include documents in the entries
    * `:with-corrections?`: specifies whether to include bitemporal corrections in the sequence, sorted first by valid-time, then transaction-time.
    * `:start` (nested map, inclusive, optional): the `:crux.db/valid-time` and `:crux.tx/tx-time` to start at.
    * `:end` (nested map, exclusive, optional): the `:crux.db/valid-time` and `:crux.tx/tx-time` to stop at.

    No matter what `:start` and `:end` parameters you specify, you won't receive
    results later than the valid-time and transact-time of this DB value.

    Each entry in the result contains the following keys:
     * `:crux.db/valid-time`,
     * `:crux.db/tx-time`,
     * `:crux.tx/tx-id`,
     * `:crux.db/content-hash`
     * `:crux.db/doc` (see `with-docs?`).")

=== valid-time

[source,clojure]
----
  (valid-time [db]
    "returns the valid time of the db.
    If valid time wasn't specified at the moment of the db value retrieval
    then valid time will be time of the latest transaction.")
----

=== transaction-time

[source,clojure]
----
  (transaction-time [db]
    "returns the time of the latest transaction applied to this db value.
    If a tx time was specified when db value was acquired then returns
    the specified time."))

== Lifecycle members

=== start-node

[source,clojure]
----
(defn start-node ^ICruxAPI [options])
----

NOTE: requires any dependendies on the classpath that the Crux modules may need.

Options:

[source,clojure]
----
{:crux.node/topology ['crux.standalone/topology]}
----

Options are specified as keywords using their long format name, like
`:crux.kafka/bootstrap-servers` etc. See the individual modules used in the specified
topology for option descriptions.

returns a node which implements ICruxAPI and
java.io.Closeable. Latter allows the node to be stopped by
calling `(.close node)`.

throws IndexVersionOutOfSyncException if the index needs rebuilding.
throws NonMonotonicTimeException if the clock has moved backwards since
last run. Only applicable when using the event log.

=== new-api-client

[source,clojure]
----
(defn new-api-client ^ICruxAPI [url])
----

Creates a new remote API client ICruxAPI. The remote client
requires valid and transaction time to be specified for all
calls to `db`.

NOTE: requires either clj-http or http-kit on the classpath,
see crux.remote-api-client/*internal-http-request-fn*
for more information.

Param `url` the URL to a Crux HTTP end-point.

Returns a remote API client.

=== new-ingest-client

[source,clojure]
----
(defn new-ingest-client ^ICruxAsyncIngestAPI [options])
----

Starts an ingest client for transacting into Kafka without running a
full local node with index.

For valid options, see crux.kafka/default-options. Options are
specified as keywords using their long format name, like
:crux.kafka/bootstrap-servers etc.

Options:

[source,clojure]
----
{:crux.kafka/bootstrap-servers "kafka-cluster-kafka-brokers.crux.svc.cluster.local:9092"
 :crux.kafka/group-id "group-id"
 :crux.kafka/tx-topic "crux-transaction-log"
 :crux.kafka/doc-topic "crux-docs"
 :crux.kafka/create-topics true
 :crux.kafka/doc-partitions 1
 :crux.kafka/replication-factor 1}
----

Returns a crux.api.ICruxIngestAPI component that implements
java.io.Closeable, which allows the client to be stopped by calling
close.
