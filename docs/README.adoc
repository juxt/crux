= Building the website

To build the website we are using [Antora](https://docs.antora.org/antora/2.3/) to build the Asciidoctor files within the main Crux repository, and then uploading the built site into S3 (used, with CloudFront, to host the website).## DependenciesTo build the website, you will need:

== Install

* Node/NPM
* `npm i -g @antora/cli @antora/site-generator-default`
* AWS CLI to deploy
* `git submodule update --init crux-site`

== Building

* Build the UI bundle with `./crux-site/bin/build-bundle.sh`
* Build the site with `./bin/build.sh`

== Deploying

Deploy a publicly-accessible preview

* Run `./bin/deploy.sh`
* By default this will deploy to `https://opencrux.com/_<whoami>/`
* Set `OPENCRUX_PREFIX` to default to something other than `whoami`

Deploy to the live site

* Run `./bin/deploy.sh /`
* Note that `/` implies the use of top-level domain routes
