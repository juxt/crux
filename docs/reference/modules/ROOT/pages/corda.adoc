= Corda

https://github.com/juxt/crux-corda[Crux-corda] is a library meant to run within a https://corda.net[Corda] Distributed Ledger which pipes verified https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.8/api-transactions.html[Corda transactions] into a https://opencrux.com[Crux] node, in order to enable Crux bi-temporal querying.

WARNING: This library is in alpha and likely to change.
WARNING: `crux-corda` is currently compatible with `crux` no __later__ than version https://github.com/juxt/crux/releases/tag/21.01-1.14.0[`21.01-1.14.0-beta`]
WARNING: `crux-corda` has not yet been released to Maven. In order to use the software, it is necessary to clone the https://github.com/juxt/crux-corda[repository]
NOTE: This documentation assumes you have a minimal knowledge of Corda and have gone through basic tutorials such as the `IOU CorDApp` from the official https://docs.corda.net/docs/corda-os/4.7/hello-world-introduction.html[Hello World tutorial]
NOTE: Corda uses primarily https://gradle.org[Gradle] as a build tool.

== Setup

=== CruxState interface

`crux.corda.state.CruxState` is the interface all Corda State objects we intend to query using Crux must implement.

.link:/iou-contract/src/main/kotlin/com/example/contract/IOUState.kt[] - example of a Corda state with a Crux mapping
[source,kotlin]
----
@BelongsToContract(IOUContract::class)
data class IOUState(val value: Int,
                    val lender: Party,
                    val borrower: Party,
                    override val linearId: UniqueIdentifier = UniqueIdentifier()) :
    LinearState, CruxState {

    override val cruxId = linearId.id
    override val cruxDoc: Map<String, Any> = mapOf(
        "iou-state/value" to value,
        "iou-state/lender" to lender.name.toString(),
        "iou-state/borrower" to borrower.name.toString())
}
----

=== Crux node

A Crux node can be instantiated within a `net.corda.core.node.services.CordaService` decorator so it's registered as a node service, and available within Corda at runtime.

Within the `@CordaService` class itself, the Crux node *must* be instantiated by calling `net.corda.core.node.AppServiceHub.startCruxNode()` with the `AppServiceHub` member instead of Crux's native `crux.api.Crux.startNode()`.

As `AppServiceHub.startCruxNode()` is but a wrapper around `Crux.startNode()`, Crux can be configured as such.

WARNING: Crux *must* be configured with `crux.corda.withCordaTxLog()`, which is the default behavior of `AppServiceHub.startCruxNode()`. By default, `CordaTxLog` is configured to only pipe Corda States that implement `CruxState` into Crux. 

.Below is an example Crux node instatiation that replicates the default behavior in `AppServiceHub.startCruxNode()`
[source,kotlin]
----
@CordaService
class CruxService(private val serviceHub: AppServiceHub) : SingletonSerializableAsToken() {
    val node = serviceHub.startCruxNode {
        withCordaTxLog {
            withDocumentMapping { doc ->
                if (doc is CruxState) listOf(doc)
                else null
            }
        }
    }
}
----

== Querying Crux

Refer to the https://opencrux.com/reference/{crux_version}/queries.html[Queries API] directly.

[source,kotlin]
----
val cruxNode = serviceHub.cordaService(CruxService::class.java)

cruxNode.db().query("""
    {:find [?l ?b ?v]
     :where [[?iou :iou-state/lender ?l]
             [?iou :iou-state/borrower ?b]
             [?iou :iou-state/value ?v]]}
    """.trimIndent())
----

TIP: Keep in mind the Crux database is not global, but local to each Corda node. You can't query facts that have happened in other nodes unless explicitly shared with yours through a Corda Flow.
