with few lifecycle members added.

== Lifecycle members

=== start-node

[source,clj]
----
(defn start-node ^ICruxAPI [options])
----

NOTE: requires any dependendies on the classpath that the Crux modules may need.

Options:

[source,clj]
----
{:crux.node/topology e.g. "crux.standalone/topology"}
----

Options are specified as keywords using their long format name, like
`:crux.kafka/bootstrap-servers` etc. See the individual modules used in the specified
topology for option descriptions.

returns a node which implements ICruxAPI and
java.io.Closeable. Latter allows the node to be stopped by
calling `(.close node)`.

throws IndexVersionOutOfSyncException if the index needs rebuilding.
throws NonMonotonicTimeException if the clock has moved backwards since
last run. Only applicable when using the event log.

=== new-api-client

[source,clj]
----
(defn new-api-client ^ICruxAPI [url])
----

Creates a new remote API client ICruxAPI. The remote client
requires valid and transaction time to be specified for all
calls to `db`.

NOTE: requires either clj-http or http-kit on the classpath,
see crux.remote-api-client/*internal-http-request-fn*
for more information.

Param `url` the URL to a Crux HTTP end-point.

Returns a remote API client.

=== new-ingest-client

[source,clj]
----
(defn new-ingest-client ^ICruxAsyncIngestAPI [options])
----

Starts an ingest client for transacting into Kafka without running a
full local node with index.

For valid options, see crux.kafka/default-options. Options are
specified as keywords using their long format name, like
:crux.kafka/bootstrap-servers etc.

Options:

[source,clj]
----
{:crux.kafka/bootstrap-servers "kafka-cluster-kafka-brokers.crux.svc.cluster.local:9092"
:crux.kafka/group-id           "group-id"
:crux.kafka/tx-topic           "crux-transaction-log"
:crux.kafka/doc-topic          "crux-docs"
:crux.kafka/create-topics      true
:crux.kafka/doc-partitions     1
:crux.kafka/replication-factor 1}
----

Returns a crux.api.ICruxIngestAPI component that implements
java.io.Closeable, which allows the client to be stopped by calling
close.
