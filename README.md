Crux is an open source document database with bitemporal graph queries. Java,
Clojure and HTTP APIs are provided.

Crux follows an _unbundled_ architectural approach, which means that it is
assembled from highly decoupled components through the use of semi-immutable
logs at the core of its design. Logs can currently be stored in LMDB or RocksDB
for standalone single-node deployments, or using Kafka for clustered
deployments. Indexes can currently be stored using LMDB or RocksDB.

Crux is built for efficient bitemporal indexing of schemaless documents, and
this simplicity enables broad possibilities for creating layered extensions on
top, such as to add additional transaction, query, and schema capabilities.
Crux does not currently support SQL but it does provide an EDN-based
[Datalog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) query interface that can be
used to express a comprehensive range of SQL-like join operations as well as
recursive graph traversals.

Crux has been available as a *Public Alpha* since 19<sup>th</sup> April 2019.
The Public Alpha period will continue until Crux is released as a Generally
Available open source software product by JUXT later in 2019.

## Unbundled Architecture

Crux embraces the transaction log as the central point of coordination when
running as a distributed system. Use of a separate document log enables simple
eviction of active and historical data to assist with technical compliance for
information privacy regulations.

<img alt="Unbundled Architecture Diagram" role="img" aria-label="Crux Venn" src="./docs/img/crux-system-1.svg" width="1000px">

This design makes it feasible and desirable to embed Crux nodes directly in
your application processes, which reduces deployment complexity and eliminates
round-trip overheads when running complex application queries.

###

## Data Model

<img alt="Document database with graph queries" role="img" aria-label="Crux Venn" src="./docs/img/crux-venn-1.svg" width="500px">

Crux is fundamentally a store of versioned EDN documents. The only requirement
is that you specify a valid `:crux.db/id` key. The fields within these
documents are automatically indexed as Entity-Attribute-Value triples to
support efficient graph queries. Document versions are indexed by `valid-time`
in addition to `transaction-time` which allows you to make updates into the
past, present or future.

Crux supports a Datalog query interface for reading data and traversing
relationships across all documents. Queries are executed so that the results
are lazily streamed from the underlying indexes. Queries can be made against
point-in-time snapshots of your database (by specifying `transaction-time` and/or
`valid-time`).

## Using Clojure

Please note that Clojure is not _required_ when using Crux. HTTP and Java
APIs are also available.

### REPL

Launch a REPL using the latest Clojars release:

``` sh
clj -Sdeps '{:deps {juxt/crux-core {:mvn/version "RELEASE"}}}'
```

Start a standalone in-memory system:

``` clojure
(require '[crux.api :as crux])
(import '[crux.api ICruxAPI])

(def my-system
  (crux/start-standalone-system
    {:kv-backend "crux.kv.memdb.MemKv" ; see docs for LMDB/RocksDB storage options
     :event-log-dir "data/event-log-dir-1"
     :db-dir "data/db-dir-1"}))
```

`put` a document:

``` clojure
(def my-document
  {:crux.db/id :some/fancy-id
   :arbitrary-key ["an untyped value" 123]
   {:maps "can be" :keys 2} {"and values" :can-be-arbitrarily-nested}})

(crux/submit-tx my-system [[:crux.tx/put my-document]])
```

Take an immutable snapshot of the database:

``` clojure
(def my-db (crux/db my-system))
```

Retrieve the current version of the document:

``` clojure
(crux/entity my-db :some/fancy-id)
```

### Testing

The recommended way of running the primary tests is `lein build`.
