= Design

== Philosophy

Crux is an unbundled database, where parts are pluggable and can be
swapped out for alternative implementations. We are attempting to
follow the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_philosophy[Unix
philosophy] of each part doing one thing well.

This document walks through some of the high-level Crux components.

== ObjectStore

Crux contains an ObjectStore for storing and retreiving documents.

[source,clj]
----
include::../src/crux/db.clj[tags=ObjectStore]
----

The main implementation is `KvObjectStore` wrapped by
`CachedObjectstore`.

NOTE: Objects are stored against used their hashed value.

NOTE: The `KvObjectStore` wraps the lower-level `KvStore`

== KvStore

[source,clj]
----
include::../src/crux/kv.clj[tags=KvStore]
----

The `KvStore` exposes the operations Crux needs to use a Key Value store for
indexing purposes, and for storing Objects.

Implementations of the `KvStore` include:

.KvStores
[#table-conversion%header,cols="d,d"]
|===
|Implementation|Description
|`crux.kv.rocksdb/RocksKv`|Uses https://rocksdb.org/[RocksDB] and the standard Java API that ships with RocksDB
|`crux.kv.rocksdb.jnr/RocksJNRKv`|Uses https://rocksdb.org/[RocksDB] and a custom built JNR bridge
|`crux.kv.lmdb/LMDBKv`|Uses https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning_Memory-Mapped_Database[LMBD] via `lwjql`
|`crux.kv.lmdb.jnr.LMDBJNRKv`|Uses LMDB via `lmdbjava`
|`crux.kv.memdb/MemKv`|An in-memory KvStore
|===

== TxLog

Crux uses a replayable transaction log that is used to derive indicies.

[source,clj]
----
include::../src/crux/db.clj[tags=TxLog]
----

The transaction log is used to write both transaction and documents to
an appendable transaction log.

.TxLogs
[#table-conversion%header,cols="d,d"]
|===
|Implementation|Description
|`crux.kafka.KafkaTxLog`|(default), using Kafka with separate Kafka topics for both documents and transactions
|`crux.tx.EventTxLog`| Uses the KvStore for the transaction log in standalone mode, backed by `moberg`. This is useful when Kafka isn't desired, and the topology of having distributed Crux nodes feeding of a centralised transaction log isn't required.
|===

== Indexer

The indexer indexes documents and transactions for query
purposes. This might be on the back of subscriptions to Kafka topics,
or by direct calls made in a single node topological setup.

[source,clj]
----
include::../src/crux/db.clj[tags=Indexer]
----

The single implememention is `crux.tx.KvIndexer`, which makes use of
the `KvStore` to persist indices.

== Query Design

=== Index

Crux has the fundamental notion of an index.

[source,clj]
----
include::../src/crux/db.clj[tags=Index]
----

The two operations are `seek` and `next`.

=== Layered Index

The layered index exists to faciliate the idea of navigating up and
down an index, in a tree like manner.

[source,clj]
----
include::../src/crux/db.clj[tags=LayeredIndex]
----

For example the index `attribute+value+entity+content-hash` is the following tree:

[graphviz, diagram-classes, png]
....
digraph G
{
attribute->value
value->entity
entity->content

}
....

`open-level` gives instructions to open and move down a level. In the
above example it could be moving the index down to point at the values
within a given attribute. That is to say that if we have an attribute
`:name`, the index will iterate across all values for that attribute,
until there are no more `name` values.

`close-level` moves the index back-up, so in the above example, we can
iterate at the higher level of attribute.

=== Virtual Index

A Virtual Index comprises together multiple child indices. This is
to join indices together, returning key/value pairs on where they match.

A join condition in a query could be reflected by a Virtual Index. A
Virtual Index will maintain state as to where Index is currently
positioned.

`UnaryJoinVirtualIndex` comprises of multiple child indices and
implements both `Index` and `LayeredIndex`. Calling `seek-values` on
it will advance all the child indices internally until they all
contain the same key. This involves calling `seek-values` on each
child index until the indices match at the same level. Calling
`next-values` would move all the indices along until the next common
key that all the indices share.

.Virtual Index Example
[#virtual-index,cols="d,d,d,d,s,d,s,d"]
|===
|`a`|0|1||3|4|5|6
|`b`|0||2|3||5|
|`c`|||2|3|4|5|6
|===

In the above example, where `UnaryJoinVirtualIndex` joins three
`RelationVirtualIndexs` (a,b,c). Calling `seek-values` would return 3
as the first value found.

Calling `next-values` would jump ahead to the value 5.
