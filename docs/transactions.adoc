[#transactions-overview]
== Overview

There are four transaction (write) operations:

.Write Operations
[#table-conversion%header,cols="d,d"]
|===
|Operation|Purpose
|`crux.tx/put`|Write a version of a document
|`crux.tx/cas`|_Compare and swap_ the version of a document, if that version is as expected
|`crux.tx/delete`|Deletes the specific document at a given `valid time`
|`crux.tx/evict`|Evicts a document entirely, including all historical versions
|===

A document looks like this:

[source,clj]
----
{:crux.db/id :dbpedia.resource/Pablo-Picasso
 :name "Pablo"
 :last-name "Picasso"}
----

In practice when using Crux, one calls `crux.db/submit-tx` with a
sequence of transaction operations:

[source,clj]
----
[[:crux.tx/put
 {:crux.db/id :dbpedia.resource/Pablo-Picasso
  :name "Pablo"
  :last-name "Picasso"}
 #inst "2018-05-18T09:20:27.966-00:00"]]
----

If the transaction contains CAS operations, all CAS operations must pass
their pre-condition check or the entire transaction is aborted. This
happens at the query node during indexing, and not when submitting the
transaction.

For operations containing documents, the id and the document are
hashed, and the operation and hash is submitted to the `tx-topic` in
the event log. The document itself is submitted to the `doc-topic`,
using its content hash as key. In Kafka, the `doc-topic` is compacted,
which enables later deletion of documents.

[#transactions-valid-ids]
== Valid IDs

The following types of `:crux.db/id` are allowed:

* Keyword (e.g. `{:crux.db/id :my-id}` or `{:crux.db/id :dbpedia.resource/Pablo-Picasso}`)
* UUID (e.g. `{:crux.db/id #uuid "6f0232d0-f3f9-4020-a75f-17b067f41203"}` or `{:crux.db/id #crux/id "6f0232d0-f3f9-4020-a75f-17b067f41203"}`)
* URI (e.g. `{:crux.db/id #crux/id "mailto:crux@juxt.pro"}`)
* URL (e.g. `{:crux.db/id #crux/id "https://github.com/juxt/crux"}`), including `http`, `https`, `ftp` and `file` protocols
* Maps (e.g. `{:crux.db/id #crux/id {:this :id-field}}`) (Note: see https://github.com/juxt/crux/issues/362[issue #362]).

The `#crux/id` reader literal will take any string and attempt to coerce it
into a valid ID. Use of `#crux/id` with a valid ID type will also work
(e.g. `{:crux.db/id #crux/id :my-id}`).

URIs and URLs are interpreted using Java classes (java.net.URI and java.net.URL respectively) and therefore you can also use these directly.

[#transactions-put]
== Put

Put's a document into Crux. If a document already exists with the
given `:crux.db/id`, a new version of this document will be created at
the supplied `valid time`.

[source,clojure]
----
[:crux.tx/put
 {:crux.db/id :dbpedia.resource/Pablo-Picasso :first-name :Pablo} <1>
 #inst "2018-05-18T09:20:27.966-00:00"] <2>
----

<1> The document itself. Note that the ID must be included as part of the
document.
<2> `valid time`

Note that `valid time` is optional and defaults to transaction time,
which is taken from the Kafka log.

Crux currently writes into the past at a single point, so to overwrite
several versions or a range in time, one is required to submit a
transaction containing several operations.

[#transactions-cas]
== CAS

The CAS operation (_compare and swap_) swaps an existing document version with a
newer one, if the existing document is as expected.

[source,clojure]
----
[:crux.tx/cas
 {..} <1>
 {..} <2>
  #inst "2018-05-18T09:21:31.846-00:00"] <3>
----

<1> Expected Document
<2> New document
<3> `valid time`

[#transactions-delete]
== Delete

Deletes a document at a given `valid time`. Historical version of the
document will still be available.

[source,clojure]
----
[:crux.tx/delete :dbpedia.resource/Pablo-Picasso
#inst "2018-05-18T09:21:52.151-00:00"]
----

[#transactions-evict]
== Evict

Evicts a document from Crux. Historical versions of the documents will no longer be available.

[source,clojure]
----
[:crux.tx/evict :dbpedia.resource/Pablo-Picasso]
----
