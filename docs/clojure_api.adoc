with few lifecycle members added.

     When a valid time is specified then returned db value contains only those
     documents whose valid time is not after the specified. Non-blocking.

     When both valid and transaction time are specified returns a db value
     as of the valid and transaction time. Will block until the transaction
     time is present in the index.")

=== sync

[source,clj]
----
 (sync
    [node]
    [node ^Duration timeout]
    "Blocks until the node has caught up indexing to the latest tx available at

  used as the second parameter in (db valid-time, transaction-time) for
  consistent reads.

  timeout â€“ max time to wait, can be nil for the default.

  operations, which allow the contents under the :crux.api/tx-ops
  key to be piped into (submit-tx tx-ops) of another
  Crux instance.
  from-tx-id      optional transaction id to start from.
  with-ops?       should the operations with documents be included?

[source,clj]
----
  (attribute-stats [node]

[#clojure-api-icruxdatasource]
== ICruxDatasource
Represents the database as of a specific valid and transaction time.

=== entity

[source,clj]
----
  (entity [db eid]
    "queries a document map for an entity.
    eid is an object which can be coerced into an entity id.
    returns the entity document map.")
----

=== entity-tx

[source,clj]
----
  (entity-tx [db eid]
    "returns the transaction details for an entity. Details
    include tx-id and tx-time.

----

=== new-snapshot

[source,clj]
----
  (new-snapshot ^java.io.Closeable [db]
     "Returns a new implementation specific snapshot allowing for lazy query
     results in a try-with-resources block using (q db  snapshot  query)}.
     Can also be used for
     (history-ascending db snapshot  eid) and
     (history-descending db snapshot  eid)
     returns an implementation specific snapshot")
----

=== q

[source,clj]
----
  (q
    [db query]
    [db snapshot query]
    "q[uery] a Crux db.
    query param is a datalog query in map, vector or string form.
    First signature will evaluate eagerly and will return a set or vector
    of result tuples.
    Second signature accepts a db snapshot, see `new-snapshot`.
    Evaluates *lazily* consequently returns lazy sequence of result tuples.")
----

=== history-ascending

[source,clj]

[source,clj]
----
  (valid-time [db]

=== transaction-time

[source,clj]
----
  (transaction-time [db]
    "returns the time of the latest transaction applied to this db value.
    If a tx time was specified when db value was acquired then returns
    the specified time."))

== Lifecycle members

=== start-node

[source,clj]
----
(defn start-node ^ICruxAPI [options])
----

NOTE: requires any dependendies on the classpath that the Crux modules may need.

Options:

[source,clj]
----
{:crux.node/topology ['crux.standalone/topology]}
----

Options are specified as keywords using their long format name, like
`:crux.kafka/bootstrap-servers` etc. See the individual modules used in the specified
topology for option descriptions.

returns a node which implements ICruxAPI and
java.io.Closeable. Latter allows the node to be stopped by
calling `(.close node)`.

throws IndexVersionOutOfSyncException if the index needs rebuilding.
throws NonMonotonicTimeException if the clock has moved backwards since
last run. Only applicable when using the event log.

=== new-api-client

[source,clj]
----
(defn new-api-client ^ICruxAPI [url])
----

Creates a new remote API client ICruxAPI. The remote client
requires valid and transaction time to be specified for all
calls to `db`.

NOTE: requires either clj-http or http-kit on the classpath,
see crux.remote-api-client/*internal-http-request-fn*
for more information.

Param `url` the URL to a Crux HTTP end-point.

Returns a remote API client.

=== new-ingest-client

[source,clj]
----
(defn new-ingest-client ^ICruxAsyncIngestAPI [options])
----

Starts an ingest client for transacting into Kafka without running a
full local node with index.

For valid options, see crux.kafka/default-options. Options are
specified as keywords using their long format name, like
:crux.kafka/bootstrap-servers etc.

Options:

[source,clj]
----
{:crux.kafka/bootstrap-servers "kafka-cluster-kafka-brokers.crux.svc.cluster.local:9092"
:crux.kafka/group-id           "group-id"
:crux.kafka/tx-topic           "crux-transaction-log"
:crux.kafka/doc-topic          "crux-docs"
:crux.kafka/create-topics      true
:crux.kafka/doc-partitions     1
:crux.kafka/replication-factor 1}
----

Returns a crux.api.ICruxIngestAPI component that implements
java.io.Closeable, which allows the client to be stopped by calling
close.
