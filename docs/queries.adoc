[#queries-intro]
== Introduction

Crux is a document database that provides you with a comprehensive means of
traversing and querying across all of your documents and data without any need
to define a schema ahead of time. This is possible because Crux is "schemaless"
and automatically indexes the top-level fields in all of your documents to
support efficient ad-hoc joins and retrievals. With these capabilities you can
quickly build queries that match directly against the relations in your data
without worrying too much about the shape of your documents or how that shape
might change in future.

Crux is also a graph database. The central characteristic of a graph database
is that it can support arbitrary-depth graph queries (recursive traversals)
very efficiently by default, without any need for schema-level optimisations.
Crux gives you the ability to construct graph queries via a Datalog query
language and uses graph-friendly indexes to provide a powerful set of querying
capabilities. Additionally, when Crux's indexes are deployed directly alongside
your application you are able to easily blend Datalog and code together to
construct highly complex graph algorithms.

This page walks through many of the more interesting queries that run as part
of Crux's default test suite. See `test/crux/query_test.clj` for the full suite
of query tests and how each test listed below runs in the wider context.

Extensible Data Notation (edn) is used as the data format for the public Crux
APIs. To gain an understanding of edn see
<<#tutorials-essential-edn, Essential EDN for Crux>>.

Note that all Crux Datalog queries run using a point-in-time view of the
database which means the query capabilities and patterns presented in this
section are not aware of valid times or transaction times.

[#queries_basic_query]
== Basic Query

A Datalog query consists of a set of variables and a set of clauses. The result
of running a query is a result set (or lazy sequence) of the possible
combinations of values that satisfy all of the clauses at the same time. These
combinations of values are referred to as "tuples".

The possible values within the result tuples are derived from your database of
documents. The documents themselves are represented in the database indexes as
"entity–attribute–value" (EAV) facts. For example, a single document
`{:crux.db/id :myid :color "blue" :age 12}` is transformed into two facts
`[[:myid :color "blue"][:myid :age 12]]`.

In the most basic case, a Datalog query works by searching for "subgraphs" in
the database that match the pattern defined by the clauses. The values within
these subgraphs are then returned according to the list of return variables
requested in the `:find` vector within the query.

Our first query runs on a database that contains the following 3 documents
which get broken apart and indexed as "entities":
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-input]
----

Note that `:ivan`, `:petr` and `:smith` are edn keywords, which may be used as
document IDs in addition to UUIDs.

The following query has 3 clauses, represented as edn vectors within the
`:where` vector. These clauses constrain the result set to match only the
entity (or subgraph of interconnected entities) that satisfy all 3 clauses at
once:

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=basic-query]
----

Let's try to work out what these 3 clauses do...

`p1` and `n` are logical variables. Logic variables are often prefixed with `?`
for clarity but this is optional.

`[p1 :name n]` is looking for all entities that have a value under the
attribute of `:name` and then binds the corresponding entity ID to `p1` and the
corresponding value to `n`. Since all 3 entities in our database have a `:name`
attribute, this clause alone will simply return all 3 entities.

`[p1 :last-name n]` reuses the variable `n` from the previous clause
which is significant because it constrains the query to only look for entities
where the value of `:name` (from the first clause) is _equal to_ the value of
`:last-name` (from the second clause). Looking at documents that were processed
by our database there is only one possible entity that can be returned, because
it has the same values `:name` and `:last-name`.

`[p1 :name "Smith"]` only serves to reinforce the conclusion from the previous
two clauses which is that the variable `n` can only be matched against the
string `"Smith"` within our database.

...so what is the actual result of the query? Well that is defined by the
`:find` vector which states that only the values corresponding to `p1` should
be returned, which in this case is simply `:smith` (the keyword database ID for
the document relating to our protagonist "Smith Smith"). Results are returned
as an edn set, which means duplicate results will not appear.

Passing the query into `crux.api/q` (see how to <<#get-started-query,submit a query>> in 'Get Started'), you get an edn result set containing the value `:smith`

[#queries_arguments]
== Arguments

For the next set of queries we will again use the same set of documents for our database as used in the previous section:

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-input]
----

=== Query: "Match on entity ID and value"

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-arguments1]
----

Our first query supplies two arguments to the query via a map within the `:args` vector. The effect of this is to make sure that regardless of whether other `:name` values in the database also equal `"Ivan"`, that only the entity with an ID matching our specific `:ivan` ID is considered within the query. Use of arguments means we can avoid hard-coding values directly into the query clauses.

Result Set:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-arguments1-r]
----

=== Query: "Match entities with given values"

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-arguments2]
----

This next query shows how multiple argument values can be mapped to a single field. This allows us to usefully parameterise the input to a query such that we do not have to rerun a single query multiple times (which would be significantly less efficient!).

Result Set:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-arguments2-r]
----

=== Query: "Match entities with given value tuples"

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-arguments3]
----

Here we see how we can extend the parameterisation to match using multiple fields at once.

Result Set:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-arguments3-r]
----

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-arguments4-r]
----

=== Query: "Use range constraints with arguments"

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-arguments5]
----

Finally we can see how we can return an argument that passes all of the predicates by including it in the `:find` vector. This essentially bypasses any interaction with the data in our database.

Result Set:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-arguments5-r]
----

[#queries_predicates]
== Predicates

Something else we can do with arguments is apply *predicates* to them directly within the clauses. Predicates return either `true` or `false` but all predicates used in clauses must return `true` in order for the given combination of field values to be part of the valid result set:

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-arguments4]
----

In this case only `:name "Ivan"` satisfies `[(re-find #"I" n)]` (which returns true for any values that begin with "I"). Any *fully qualified* Clojure function function that returns a boolean can be used in place of `re-find`, for example:

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-pred-1]
----

Result:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-with-pred-1-r]
----


[#queries_valid_time_travel]
== Valid time travel

Congratulations! You already know enough about queries to build a simple CRUD application with Crux. However, your manager has just told you that the new CRUD application you have been designing needs to backfill the historical document versions from the legacy CRUD application. Luckily Crux makes it easy for your application to both insert and retrieve these old versions.

Here we will see how you are able to run queries at a given point in the valid time axis against, implicitly, the most recent transaction time.

First, we transact a very old document into the database with the ID `:malcolm` and the `:name` `"Malcolm"`, and specify the `valid time` instant at which this document became valid in the legacy system: `#inst "1986-10-22"`.

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-at-t-d1]
----

Next we transact a slightly more recent (though still very old!) revision of that same document where the `:name` has been corrected to `"Malcolma"`, again using a historical timestamp extracted from the legacy system.

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-at-t-d2]
----

We are then able to query at different points in the valid time axis to check for the validity of the correction. We define a query `q`:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-at-t-q1]
----

Firstly we can verify that `"Malcolma"` was unknown at `#inst "1986-10-23"`.

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-at-t-q1-q]
----

Result Set:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-at-t-q1-r]
----

We can then verify that `"Malcolma"` is the currently known `:name` for the entity
with ID `:malcolm` by simply not specifying a valid time alongside the query.
This will be the case so long as there are no newer versions (in the valid time axis)
of the document that affect the current valid time version.

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-at-t-q2-q]
----

Result Set:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=query-at-t-q2-r]
----


[#queries_joins]
== Joins

=== Query: "Join across entities on a single attribute"

Given the following documents in the database
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=join-d]
----

We can run a query to return a set of tuples that satisfy the join on the attribute `:name`
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=join-q]
----

Result Set:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=join-r]
----

Note that every person joins once, plus 2 more matches.

=== Query: "Join with two attributes, including a multi-valued attribute"

Given the following documents in the database
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=join2-d]
----

We can run a query to return a set of entities that `:follows` the set of entities with the `:name` value of `"Ivan"`
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=join2-q]
----

Result Set:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=join2-r]
----

Note that because Crux is schemaless there is no need to have elsewhere declared that the `:follows` attribute may take a value of edn type `set`.

[#queries_ordering_and_pagination]
== Ordering and Pagination

A Datalog query naturally returns a result set of tuples, however, the tuples
can also be consumed as a lazy sequence and therefore you will always have an
implicit order available. Ordinarily this implicit order is not meaningful
because the join order and result order are unlikely to correlate.

The `:order-by` option is available for use in the query map to explicitly
control the result order.

[source,clj]
----
'{:find [time device-id temperature humidity]
  :where [[c :condition/time time]
          [c :condition/device-id device-id]
          [c :condition/temperature temperature]
          [c :condition/humidity humidity]]
  :order-by [[time :desc] [device-id :asc]]}
----

Use of `:order-by` will typically require that results are fully-realised by
the query engine, however this happens transparently and it will automatically
spill to disk when sorting large result sets.

Basic `:offset` and `:limit` options are supported however typical pagination
use-cases will need a more comprehensive approach because `:offset` will
naively scroll through the initial result set each time.

[source,clj]
----
'{:find [time device-id temperature humidity]
  :where [[c :condition/time time]
          [c :condition/device-id device-id]
          [c :condition/temperature temperature]
          [c :condition/humidity humidity]]
  :order-by [[device-id :asc]]
  :limit 10
  :offset 90}
----

Pagination relies on efficient retrieval of explicitly ordered documents and
this may be achieved using a user-defined attribute with values that get sorted
in the desired order. You can then use this attribute within your Datalog
queries to apply range filters using predicates.

[source,clj]
----
{:find '[time device-id temperature humidity]
 :where '[[c :condition/time time]
          [c :condition/device-id device-id]
          [(>= device-id my-offset)]
          [c :condition/temperature temperature]
          [c :condition/humidity humidity]]
 :order-by '[[device-id :asc]]
 :limit 10
 :args [{'my-offset 990}]}
----

Additionally, since Crux stores documents and can traverse arbitrary keys as
document references, you can model the ordering of document IDs with vector
values, e.g. `{:crux.db/id :zoe :closest-friends [:amy :ben :chris]}`

More powerful ordering and pagination features may be provided in the future.
Feel free to open an issue or get in touch to discuss your requirements.

[#queries_rules]
== Rules

This example of a rule demonstrates a recursive traversal of entities that are
connected to a given entity via the `:follow` attribute.

[source,clj]
----
'{:find [?e2]
  :where [(follow ?e1 ?e2)]
  :args [{?e1 :1}]
  :rules [[(follow ?e1 ?e2)
           [?e1 :follow ?e2]]
          [(follow ?e1 ?e2)
           [?e1 :follow ?t]
           (follow ?t ?e2)]]})
----

[#queries_lazy_queries]
== Lazy Queries

The function `crux.api/q` takes 2 or 3 arguments, `db` and `q` but also
optionally a `snapshot` which is already opened and managed by the caller
(using `with-open` for example). This version of the call returns a lazy
sequence of the results, while the other version provides a set. A snapshot can
be retrieved from a `kv` instance via `crux.api/new-snapshot`. For example, a lazy version of a basic query from the top of this section (using `with-open` to ensure that the snapshot is closed):

[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=lazy-query]
----

This will lazily return:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=lazy-query-r]
----

[#queries_history_api]
== History API

[#history_full_document_history]
=== Full Document History
Crux allows you to retrieve all versions of a document:
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=history-full]
----

[#history_document_history_range]
=== Document History Range
Retrievable document versions can be bounded by four time coordinates:

* valid-time-start
* tx-time-start
* valid-time-end
* tx-time-end

All coordinates are inclusive. All coordinates can be null.
[source,clj]
----
include::./src/docs/examples.clj[tags=history-range]
----

[#queries_clojure_tips]
== Clojure Tips

=== Quoting

Logic variables used in queries must always be quoted in the `:find` and
`:where` clauses, which in the most minimal case could look like the following:

[source,clj]
----
(crux/q db
  {:find ['?e]
   :where [['?e :event/employee-code '?code]]}))
----

However it is often convenient to quote entire clauses or even the entire query
map rather than each individual use of every logical variable, for instance:

[source,clj]
----
(crux/q db
  '{:find [?e]
    :where [[?e :event/employee-code ?code]]}))
----

Confusion may arise when you later attempt to introduce references to Clojure
variables within your query map, such as when using `:args`. This can be
resolved by introducing more granular quoting for specific parts of the query
map:

[source,clj]
----
(let [my-code 101214]
  (crux/q db
    {:find '[?e]
     :where '[[?e :event/employee-code ?code]]
     :args [{'?code my-code}]}))
----

=== Maps and Vectors in data

Say you have a document like so and you want to add it to a Crux db:
[source,clj]
----
{:crux.db/id :me
 :list ["carrots" "peas" "shampoo"]
 :pockets {:left ["lint" "change"]
           :right ["phone"]}}
----

Crux breaks down vectors into individual components so the query engine is able
see all elements on the base level. As a result of this the query engine is not
required to traverse any structures or any other types of search algorithm
which would slow the query down. The same thing should apply for maps so
instead of doing `:pocket {:left thing :right thing}` you should put them under
a namespace, instead structuring the data as `:pocket/left thing :pocket/right
thing` to put the data all on the base level. Like so:

[source,clj]
----
(crux/submit-tx
  node
  [[:crux.tx/put
    {:crux.db/id :me
     :list ["carrots" "peas" "shampoo"]
     :pockets/left ["lint" "change"]
     :pockets/right ["phone"]}]
   [:crux.tx/put
    {:crux.db/id :you
     :list ["carrots" "tomatoes" "wig"]
     :pockets/left ["wallet" "watch"]
     :pockets/right ["spectacles"]}]])
----

To query inside these vectors the code would be:

[source,clj]
----
(crux/q (crux/db node) '{:find [e l]
                         :where [[e :list l]]
                         :args [{l "carrots"}]})
;; => #{[:you "carrots"] [:me "carrots"]}

(crux/q (crux/db node) '{:find [e p]
                         :where [[e :pockets/left p]]
                         :args [{p "watch"}]})
;; => #{[:you "watch"]}
----

Note that `l` and `p` is returned as a single element as Crux decomposes the
vector

[#queries_datascript_differences]
== DataScript Differences

This list is not necessarily exhaustive and is based on the partial re-usage of
DataScript's query test suite within Crux's query tests.

Crux does not support:

- vars in the attribute position, such as `[e ?a "Ivan"]` or `[e _ "Ivan"]`

Crux does _not yet_ support:

- `ground`, `get-else`, `get-some`, `missing?`, `missing? back-ref`
- destructuring
- source vars, e.g. function references passed into the query via `:args`

Note that many of these _not yet_ supported query features can be achieved via
simple function calls since you can currently fully qualify any function that
is loaded. In future, limitations on available functions may be introduced to
enforce security restrictions for remote query execution.

Test queries from DataScript such as "Rule with branches" and "Mutually
recursive rules" work correctly with Crux and demonstrate advanced query
patterns. See the Crux tests for details.
