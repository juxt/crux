[#rest]
== Introduction

Crux offers a lightweight REST API layer in the `crux-http-server` module that
allows you to send transactions and run queries over HTTP. For instance, you
could deploy your Crux nodes along with Kafka into a Kubernetes pod running on
AWS and interact with Crux from your application purely via HTTP. Using Crux in
this manner is a valid use-case but it cannot support all of the features and
benfits that running the Crux node inside of your application provides, in
particular the ability to efficiently combine custom code with multiple
in-process Datalog queries.

Your application only needs to communicate with one Crux node when using the
REST API. Multiple Crux nodes can placed be behind a HTTP load balancer to
spread the writes and reads over a horizontally-scaled cluster transparently to
the application. Each Crux node in such a cluster will be independently
catching up with the head of the transaction log, and since different queries
might go to different nodes, you have to be slightly conscious of read
consistency when designing your application to use Crux in this way.
Fortunately, you can readily achieve read-your-writes consistency with the
ability to query consistent point-in-time snapshots using specific temporal
coordinates.

The REST API also provides an experimental endpoint for SPARQL 1.1
Protocol queries under `/sparql/`, rewriting the query into the Crux
Datalog dialect. Only a small subset of SPARQL is supported and no
other RDF features are available.

[#rest-http-api]
== Using the HTTP API

The HTTP interface is provided as a Ring middleware in a Clojure namespace,
located at `crux/crux-http-server/src/crux/http_server.clj`. There is an example of using this
middleware in a https://github.com/juxt/crux/tree/master/docs/example/standalone_webservice[full example HTTP server configuration].

Whilst CORS may be easily configured for use while prototyping a Single Page
Application that uses Crux directly from a web browser, it is currently NOT
recommended to expose Crux directly to any untrusted endpoints (including web
browsers) in production since the default query API does not sandbox or
otherwise restrict the execution of queries.

NOTE: `estimate-num-keys` is an (over)estimate of the number of transactions in the log (each of which is a key in RocksDB). RocksDB https://github.com/facebook/rocksdb/wiki/RocksDB-FAQ[does not provide] an exact key count.
