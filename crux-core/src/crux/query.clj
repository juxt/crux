;; TODO: For or (but not or-join) it might be possible to embed the
;; entire or expression into the parent join via either OrVirtualIndex
;; (though as all joins now are binary they have variable order
;; dependency so this might work easily) or NAryOrVirtualIndex for the
;; generic case. As constants are represented by relations, which
;; introduce new vars which would have to be lifted up to the parent
;; join as all or branches need to have the same variables. Another
;; problem when embedding joins are the sub joins constraints which
;; need to fire at the right level, but they won't currently know how
;; to translate their local join depth to the join depth in the
;; parent, which is what will be used when walking the tree. Due to
;; the way or-join (and rules) work, they likely have to stay as sub
;; queries. Recursive rules always have to be sub queries.
