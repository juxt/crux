= Upgrading

Upgrading a node from Crux version `1.X.n` to `1.Y.n` generally requires rebuilding the node's local KV index store from the golden stores, i.e. the transaction log and the document store.

You can perform this rebuild process by simply shutting down your node and removing the index-store's `db-dir` (and similarly for Lucene's `db-dir` indexes where `crux-lucene` is enabled). Crux will then rebuild the indices when the node is restarted.
